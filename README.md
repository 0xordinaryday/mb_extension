This extension will add a recent comments sidebar on MacroBusiness pages
This is a tool intended to enhance the comments section of the Australian economic blog www.macrobusiness.com.au. I am not affiliated with macrobusiness in any way and this extension is not endorsed or recommended by the site's owners or administrators. I am a member of the site (a subscriber). This extension only affects pages from the www.macrobusiness.com.au domain and it works by altering the way the information is displayed in your browser.

This extension will add a sidebar on the right hand side of any article that is opened on macrobusiness. The sidebar will contain the comments for that article listed in chronological order from newest at the top to oldest at the bottom. The sidebar can be collapsed by clicking on it and re-enlarged by clicking again on the collapsed bar. The sidebar shows the comment author, the approximate elapsed time since the comment was made, and the first 50 characters of the comment. The 'author' part is a link which will lead directly to the comment.

By clicking on the "M" icon at the top, a user can also create a 'favourites' list of commentators whose comments will be highlighted. Type the name of a commentator in the 'Member name' box and click 'Add name to favourites'. Any comments by members listed as favourites will be highlighted in the side bar in bold pink text when the comment is by that user. Names can be removed from the favourites list by first clicking 'View highlight list' then clicking directly on the name to be removed. If no names are added to the highlight list all comments will have the same appearance.

Comments can also be filtered using the filter list function that works in the same way as the highlight list above. Once the list is established, if you open an article and 'right click' you will see a 'Mute Them!' menu item appear in the context menu. Selecting this option will 'remove' (actually hide) any comments from any name on your filter list for that article. This presently works just on the displayed article, so you need to click 'Mute Them!' on each article you wish to filter the comments for.
